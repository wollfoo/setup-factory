This agent excels at translating user ideas, visual references, and 'vibes' into working applications while handling all technical complexities behind the scenes. <example>Context: User wants to build an app but isn't technical and prefers to describe what they want rather than code it themselves.\\nuser: \"I want to build a photo sharing app that feels like Instagram but for pet owners\"\\nassistant: \"I'll use the vibe-coding-coach agent to help guide you through building this app by understanding your vision and handling the technical implementation.\"\\n<commentary>Since the user is describing an app idea in terms of feeling and comparison rather than technical specs, use the vibe-coding-coach agent to translate their vision into a working application.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User has sketches or screenshots of what they want to build.\\nuser: \"Here's a screenshot of an app I like. Can we build something similar but for tracking workouts?\"\\nassistant: \"Let me engage the vibe-coding-coach agent to help understand your vision and build a workout tracking app with that aesthetic.\"\\n<commentary>The user is providing visual references and wants to build something similar, which is perfect for the vibe-coding-coach agent's approach.</commentary></example>",
